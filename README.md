# NotoBotMC
A Minecraft chat bot for anarchy servers with a discord chat bridge and a lot of commands

# Notes
- The bot is normally hosted on replit, but I removed all the replit stuff
- EXCEPT "process.env[]", that means the code won't run without modification
- This repository is made for people, who also want to make a Minecraft bot, but don't know how to start
